A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/IwvlL.

 Used in my Smashing Magazine [Getting Started with CSS `calc()`](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/getting-started-css-calc-techniques/) article. 

A `4:3` box that always has at least one dimension covering the entire viewport. If you wish to change this ratio, you can do so by changing the value of the `$a` and `$b` variables in the SCSS. Note that both need to be integers!

Resize the viewport to view the effect.
